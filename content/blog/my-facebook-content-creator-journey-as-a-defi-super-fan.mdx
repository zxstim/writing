As a Vietnamese, I have always been active on Facebook. Facebook is the de facto dominant social media in Vietnam (not Zalo which is a messaging app that tries to be a social media). Most Vietnamese use Facebook, the Vietnamese Government also uses Facebook to communicate with the public, similar to how the US Government uses X.

## Starting out

Circa May 2025, the new draft law on Digital Assets was released. It was a draft but super alarming to me, seeing how it mimics a lot of regulatory capture in the US during Gensler SEC era, plus my own experience within the Vietnam Fintech scene. In contrast to many other local "builders" who to me just simp on whatever the corporations/governments instruct them to do, I decided to take a different bottom up approach via Facebook to advocate for a better crypto regulatory framework, protecting DeFi and other onchain builders. And No, I'm not a dissident that talks crap aiming to tarnish the reputation of the Vietnamese Government. I spoke up (and continue to speak up) within my rights as a citizen of Vietnam.

Starting out was a little slow but Facebook algorithm quickly caught on and promoted my posts to a lot of people. My contents are very different from the typical Vietnamese crypto KOLs who are posting Centralized Exchange shills, meme shills or some unrelated macro economics analysis. My posts are about Ethereum, DeFi, onchain protocols, OpSec, and commentary on the regulatory framework.

## Progress

For 2025, I got 



## The gist of it

Facebook algo seems to be very forgiving. My technical posts also get decent traction compared to rage baits. Some posts went viral for very little reason like my post on cheap Ethereum mainnet gas or the TrueBit hack. They seem fairly mundane but for some reasons, the facebook god thought they were worth a lot of attention. Somewhat similar to X algo now, you don't need to post a lot daily, you can focus on one quality post per day and it compounds over time. Follower count doesn't matter that much. The algo will push your post to relevant people. There is no reply strategy to inflate views, everything is based on posts.

So if you are a crypto project looking to reach Vietnamese (or South East Asian) users, Facebook is the place to be. Given the similarity on posting cadence with X, I think you can consider a similar content style for Facebook as well. There are a lot of agencies that will try to grift you so just watch out for that.
