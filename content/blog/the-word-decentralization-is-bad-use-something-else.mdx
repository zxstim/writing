Every few months, we get another round of people claiming users don't care about "decentralization", sometimes it's a major CT account as well (like below).

Now, I do agree to [yuga.eth's notion](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/2024437304681545810) that _decentralization_ is an abstract concept of the system as a whole; it's also not something people hear everyday, so it comes out as strange or unknown. However, I am confident that people **CARE** about decentralization, they just don't word it that way. Therefore, my idea is that we should adopt a different, and more clear term for marketing.

## What is "Decentralization" to crypto people?

The term "decentralization" in the context of crypto means that the system is not controlled by a single entity. In another way, it means that power is fragmented among so many different entities that nobody can single-handedly change the system to attack or benefit on the expense of others.

I think the typical CT discourse tends to devolve into node/validator count, or geographic diversity, which is confusing to anyone without context.

## What normal people want?

In every country globally, there are always cases of authority abusing their power to cease assets of the people without fair trials. One prompt to any AI model or Google search can yield a lot of results. I put a few below for reference.

Normal people want a system that is fair, transparent and not prone to abuse by authority without due process. This is where it overlaps with what the crypto people call _decentralization_. With no single entity having the ultimate power to change the system at will, people can rest easy knowing that their assets are safe.

## So...

I think we should adopt the term _self sovereign_ to be the marketing term for crypto. It means that people are in control of their assets at all time as a result of a system like Ethereum being decentralized.
