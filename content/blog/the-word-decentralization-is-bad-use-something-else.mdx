Every few months, we get another round of people claiming users don't care about "decentralization", sometimes it's a major CT account as well (like below).

Now, I do agree to [yuga.eth's notion](https://x.com/yugacohler/status/2024437304681545810) that decentralization is an abstract concept of the system as a whole; it's also not something people hear everyday, so it comes out as strange. However, people **CARE** about decentralization, they just don't word it that way. Therefore, my idea is that we should adopt a different, and more clear term for marketing.

## What is "Decentralization"?

The term "decentralization" in the context of crypto means that the system is not controlled by a single entity. In another way, it means that power is fragmented among so many different entities that nobody can single-handedly change the system to attack or benefit on the expense of others.

I think the typical CT discourse tends to devolve into node/validator count, or geographic diversity, which is confusing to anyone without context.
