As a Vietnamese, I have always been active on Facebook. Facebook is the de facto dominant social media in Vietnam (not Zalo which is a messaging app that tries to be a social media). Most Vietnamese use Facebook, the Vietnamese Government also uses Facebook to communicate with the public, similar to how the US Government uses X.

## Starting out

Around May 2025, the new draft law on Digital Assets was released. It was a draft but super alarming to me, seeing how it mimicked a lot of regulatory capture in the US during Gensler SEC era, plus my own experience within the Vietnam Fintech scene (also got captured by local banks). In contrast to many other local "builders" who to me just simp on corporations (esp. the ones that will launch the official CEXs), I decided to take a different bottom up approach via Facebook to advocate for a better crypto regulatory framework, protecting Ethereum and DeFi, and push for serious blockchain education initiatives. I spoke up (and continue to speak up) within my rights as a citizen of Vietnam.
Starting out was a little slow but Facebook algorithm quickly caught on and promoted my posts to a lot of people. My contents are very different from the typical Vietnamese crypto KOLs who mostly post Centralized Exchange shills, meme shills or some unrelated macro economics analysis. My posts are about Ethereum, DeFi, onchain protocols, OpSec, and honest commentary on the regulatory framework.

## Progress

From May 2025 (when I started) until today, I got:

- 1,157 new followers
- 1,132,532 total views
- 8,659 reactions
- 1,671 comments
- 583 shares

## The gist of it

Facebook algorithm seems to be very forgiving. My technical posts also get decent traction compared to rage baits. Some posts that went viral like my post on cheap Ethereum mainnet gas or the TrueBit hack seem fairly niche but for some reasons, the facebook god thought they were worth a lot of attention. Somewhat similar to X algo now, you don't need to post a lot daily, you can focus on one quality post per day within a niche and it compounds over time. Follower count doesn't matter. The algo will push your post to relevant people. There is no reply strategy to get followers or inflate views, everything is based on original posts.

Facebook algo prefers longer posts and having post thumbnail images. You can think of it similar to Youtube thumbnail image which is required to catch people attention and hook them into reading your post. You also don't need to rage bait, I think just being authentic is enough to get to the right audience. Facebook also enforces its community standards very strongly, any violations will reduce the recommendation level of your profile. In addition, using a personal Facebook account that has Professional mode switched on yields better reach than Pages (Facebook version of Brand accounts). This is where the idea of Super Fan comes into play, but more on that in another article.

## So...

if you are a crypto project looking to reach Vietnamese (or South East Asian) users, Facebook is an option to seriously consider. There are a lot of agencies that will try to grift you so just watch out for that. Find your local Super Fan who will be advocating for your project and help you reach the right audience. I will write more about my perspective on the local crypto regulations, Vietnam as a crypto market and what being a Super Fan means.
